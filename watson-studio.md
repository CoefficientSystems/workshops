 * The notebook will load. 
 
To run the notebook each code cell in the notebook needs to be executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Every code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tagformat is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

1. A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
2. A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
3. A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

To execute the code cells in your notebook select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
