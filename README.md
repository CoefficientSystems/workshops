# Intro to Deep Learning with Keras

### Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. 

Choose one of the below introductions to get started:
