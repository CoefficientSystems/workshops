# Intro to Deep Learning with Keras

### Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. 

Choose one of the below introductions to get started:

- [Create an IBM Watson Studio account to run in the Cloud](https://github.com/CoefficientSystems/workshops/blob/master/watson-studio.md)
- [Local installation with Anaconda](http://jupyter.org/install)

### Workshop Notebooks

### Workshop Details

**Event URL:** https://www.meetup.com/IBM-Code-London/events/255417147/

> Deep learning is becoming increasingly powerful in its applications, from speech recognition to dog recognition, from AlphaGo to self-driving cars. It's also becoming easier and easier to jump in and use deep neural networks, with frameworks like Keras designed to facilitate fast and easy prototyping whilst remaining user friendly.

**Takeaways**
This workshop will be a (very) brief introduction to deep neural networks with a focus on using convolutional neural networks for image classification and object recognition. No prior knowledge is assumed, and we'll be starting our journey in the mid-1950s with the concept of artificial neurons, moving swiftly onto perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons, and finally into the recent advances in deep learning. The workshop will be hands-on throughout with code examples and exercises provided to apply what you've just learned.

**Pre-requisites & preparation**
- Students should have familiarity with Python. Background in linear algebra is preferred but not required. For those wishing to dig a little deeper, brilliant.org has a great free course on Artificial Neural Networks, and the "Math for Neural Networks" module is especially recommended.
- Sign up for IBM Watson Studio. Here you can create a project and run the workshop notebooks. Sign up at https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/
- Or run the workshop locally by installing Anaconda. We will be using the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6. The download comes pre- installed with a lot of the libraries required for machine learning. You can get this from https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- Install TensorFlow. Installing TensorFlow can be as simple as conda install tensorflow, although Google recommends installing the officially supported/tested version from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using pip install tensorflow. Regardless, there are full and up-to-date installation instructions here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/. If you have GPUs on your machine, then feel free to install the TensorFlow with GPU support (e.g. pip install tensorflow-gpu). Note that there are a number of pre-requisites, such as CUDA Toolkit 9.0, the associated NVIDIA drivers, cuDNN v7.0 and a GPU card with CUDA Compute Capability 3.5 or higher (this is all detailed on TensorFlow's installation guide). You do not need to enable GPU support for this workshop.
- Install Keras. This should be as simple as pip install keras from within your Anaconda environment. For more information please see: https://keras.io/#installation
